# admin-dashboard
Create an admin dashboard to practice more html and css, specifically using grid and flexbox together. Project from The Odin Project

## Goals

* Get more familiar with CSS Grid and styling a webpage from scratch.

## Reflection

* Good practice for what to do and not do with grid.
* Got a taste of blending grid and flexbox together to create the layouts I want.
* Using a box shadow generator where you can see the results in real time is much faster than experimenting with values and seeing if it produces what I want. I'm sure I'll get better at ball-parking basic ones, but being able to see the shadows when changing the numbers is much easier to zero in on what I want.
* Got some experience with different google fonts and using their icon packs.
* I feel like this is the most organized I've been with the css and html yet, but I'm sure I've got ways to go in that department.
